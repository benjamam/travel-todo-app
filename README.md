# TravelTodoApp

You can view this app live here: https://traveltodo.herokuapp.com/

It was created for me and my girlfriend, Christy, to document new places we wanted to visit. Feel free to add any of your own suggestions! 

I have a CI/CD pipeline set up to Heroku so that any changes automatically kick off a Heroku build. It is powered by a Node/Express MongoDB backend that is also hosted on Heroku. However, I have this app private as it contains some sensitive keys!


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
